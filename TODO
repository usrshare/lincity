KNOWN BUGS and MISFEATURES in version 1.14.0

* I found inconsistent behavior with using the middle mouse button
(mmb).  Clicking with mmb on mini-map causes the main win to jump, and
then jump back before scrolling.  Clicking mmb on other displays (finance
or unemployment graph) advances the display.  Probably only lmb should
advance display.  Also, I'm not sure if mmb should initiate main win
scrolling if the click was made outside the main win.

* Bits of the square cursor are not refreshed from the main win frame.
For example, this happens with pollution overlay turned on.
This problem is more pronouced in SVGA version.

* Help gets screwed up by game-related keystrokes.
Consider also pressing "Enter" when mouse is over a button on the 
*pening screen.

* Population pbar is wrong when starting new game, since game starts 
with different number of people for random villiage and blank screen 
this is difficult to fix.  GCS: I verified that this still exists, 
Apr 5, 2003.

* There still seems to be a problem with putting multi-transport off 
the bottom of the screen.  For example, resources can wrap-around 
from bottom to top.

To reproduce, put a horizontal bit of track across the top row.
Then, drag track from the city down off past the edge of the main 
screen (you might need to do this a few times).  Now check the 
track on the top, and you will see goods, jobs, etc flowing off 
the bottom into the top.

(GCS July 26, 2003) cannot reproduce in svga version, but definitely
exists in win32 version.

* Right click outside of help should exit help.

* Main screen should scroll when moving mouse outside of main window 
during multi-transport.

* Miniscreen colors could be improved.

* When a tip burns up, there is no pollution at all, and the tip disappears.
Tip should stay, should cause pollution(?).

* Technology indicator sometimes shows both a rise and fall.  This happens
after loading a game, old indicator remains as a ghost.
*  Fixed by Corey?

* There is a display bug, where a small block is left when
exiting a help page. The only happens when part of the mouse cursor is in
the main window during the re-draw. It quicky disappears when the main
window is scrolled or updated.

I've seen this display bug also happens when refreshing after 
modal dialog boxes.

* Need to clean up write of gzipped files to use popen().

* Why don't we use a recognized file format for the splash screen?

* Slight streaking in monthgraph.

* Like to have info pages and/or printed documentation.

* Animations for paths/roads/railroads.

* Coal Power Station does not accurately report actual power produced.

* More than 100% of the population can be starving.
