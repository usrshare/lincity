Description: build & maintain a city/country
 You are required to build and maintain a city. You must feed, house,
 provide jobs and goods for your residents. You can build a sustainable
 economy with the help of renewable energy and recycling, or you can go for
 broke and build rockets to escape from a pollution ridden and resource
 starved planet, it's up to you. Due to the finite resources available in any
 one place, this is not a game that you can leave for long periods of time.
 This game is similar to the commercial simulation game with a similar
 name.
